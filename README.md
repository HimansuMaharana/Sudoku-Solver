# Sudoku_Solver
This code implements a backtracking algorithm to solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. It explores different possibilities by trying to place numbers in empty cells, backtracking when a dead-end is encountered, and continuing the search until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
